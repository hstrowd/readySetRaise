General Thoughts:
 - At events where you are already putting pressure on people to do a performance, reporting on how much money they are raising may add more pressure to an already stressful thing for them.
 - Publicly displaying the pledge log is too much information.
 - There is a fine line line between things done in good taste and crossing the line.
 - You have to work it into the message (She pulled on peoples motivation: There are no ladies up here, I want to see this column shoot up to support ladies next year)
 - This is a tool. It can be used well. I need to teach people to use it well and tastefully.
